## Introduction

Pax Construct provides a Swiss ArmyÂ® knife for OSGi that helps you rapidly create, build, manage and
deploy many types of OSGi bundles. The core functionality is provided by a flexible Maven2 plugin
that enhances and streamlines the Maven build process for OSGi, along with intelligent archetypes
that adapt according to your needs.

Unix and Windows scripts are available to further reduce the need to remember (and type) long
command strings. These scripts come with basic help text and can bootstrap themselves from an
empty system.

You can use Pax Construct to create a simple first bundle in less than a minute, all the way up to
managing a Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGiTM system.
